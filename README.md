# Vision 
<h2>Cache DEFI Project is an ecosystem that will decentralize venture capital and crowdfunding with open sourced blockchain software.</h2>
<br>
# Open-Sourced Software Description 
<h2>Cache DEFI Project will create an open source blockchain software that can be used to create crowdfunding, used in venture capital or a company total shares. These tokens can be distributed within the created agreement and will be captured on either Ethereums blockchain or Binances blockchain.  The program will be compatible with both platforms.  These blockchain contracts will mint a specific number of tokens, capture specific contract information and will be immutable.  They will not be able to be changed or altered. This software will be open-sourced and free to use. </h2>
